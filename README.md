A video game developed by a group of five during a specialization course in video game and virtual reality development in 2025. It is an RPG where players must assemble a team of warriors to recover the stolen Tyr's Stone. The game is single-player with a dialogue system, randomized enemy combat, skill tree progression, and a quest system. The expansive terrain is navigated using an in-game map.
